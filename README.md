# time-and-weather
 This project demonstrates API calls, JSON parsing, mathmatical (astronomical) calculation, eventListeners, Promises and logic which displays certain holidays, or, if it is not a chosen holiday, randomly chooses an inspirational phrase to display. The phrase can be randomply changed by clicking. 

Originally a simple clock I created to make use of a 1st gen Kindle Fire that was otherwise living in the scrap tech drawer, the project has been expanded to show various useful bits of information, while demonstrating js skills.

Some of these features have been added back to my original Kindle clock.
